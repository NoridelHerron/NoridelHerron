**Computer Engineering | Digital Design | VHDL Projects**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering and have developed several RTL-based components from scratch — including a 32-bit ALU, memory modules, and a full register file — all tested with fixed and randomized testbenches.

## Featured Projects

### [INSTRUCTION_FETCH](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/INSTRUCTION_FETCH)  
VHDL implementation of the Instruction Fetch stage for a custom RISC-V pipeline CPU. Includes program counter, instruction memory interface, and testbench validation.

### [ID_STAGE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/ID_STAGE)  
Implements the Instruction Decode stage of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU. Extracts opcode, register addresses, function codes, and immediate values from a 32-bit instruction. Generates control signals and interfaces with the register file to retrieve operands.

### [EX_STAGE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/EX_STAGE)  
Execute stage for a pipelined RISC-V CPU. Integrates ALU, forwarding inputs, and control logic with pipeline register support. Validated using a randomized testbench.

### [DATA_MEM](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/DATA_MEM)  
Synchronous 32-bit word-addressable memory module with support for 1024 memory locations. Includes a reusable formatting function and randomized testbench with assertion-based verification and waveform validation.

### [ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl)  
A fully functional 32-bit ALU in VHDL with signed/unsigned operations, flag generation (Z, N, C, V), and comprehensive testbenches including randomized edge-case validation.

### [32x32-bit Register File](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/32x32-bit-Register-File-in-VHDL-)  
Implements a synchronous register file with 32 registers, each 32 bits wide. Supports dual-read, single-write, write protection for x0, and reset logic. Verified using randomized testbenches.

### [MEMORY_MODULE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/MEMORY_MODULE)  
Instruction memory unit used in the IF stage. Designed to preload instruction data for fetch testing with reset and read-only control.
