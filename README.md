**Computer Engineering | Digital Design | VHDL Projects**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering and have developed several RTL-based components from scratch — including a 32-bit ALU, memory modules, and a full register file — all tested with fixed and randomized testbenches.

## Featured Projects

### [ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl)
A fully functional 32-bit ALU in VHDL with signed/unsigned operations, flag generation (Z, N, C, V), and exhaustive testbenches with randomized edge-case detection.

### [32x32-bit Register File](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/32x32-bit-Register-File-in-VHDL-)
Implements synchronous read/write with reset logic. Compatible with 5-stage pipeline CPU integration.

### [MEMORY_MODULE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/MEMORY_MODULE)
Instruction memory unit built for IF stage testing. Tested with instruction data and zeroing logic.
