# Noridel Herron

I enjoy building systems from scratch and working close to the hardware to understand how things function at a low level. My public repositories focus on FPGA projects, CPU architectures, and HDL testbenches, where I build and verify designs from the ground up. Through these projects, I’ve developed the foundation and confidence to begin translating high-level ideas into low-level hardware implementations, which is a direction I plan to explore next. I’m not actively looking for opportunities right now — my focus is on continuing to build, refactor, and learn over time.

## 📝 Final Note

These projects started as personal challenges but evolved into something more — tools to help others learn digital design through real, reusable HDL examples.
