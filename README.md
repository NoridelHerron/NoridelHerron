## üîç About Me

I‚Äôm a Computer Engineering student with a focus on **RTL design**, **verification**, and **computer architecture**. I recently completed a custom **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU** using **Harvard architecture** in VHDL, with full support for **hazard detection**, **stalling/forwarding**, and **jump/branch execution**. My current work builds on that foundation through the development of a **Superscalar CPU**, where I‚Äôm implementing **dual-issue execution** and more advanced hazard handling.

I validate my designs through **randomized testbenches**, **assertion-based verification**, and **waveform inspection**. I enjoy tackling challenging hardware design problems and continuously seek to deepen my understanding through hands-on exploration.

## üöß Projects

### üîπ [Superscalar CPU](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/SUPERSCALAR_CPU) ‚Äì In Progress (June 2025)  
This project builds on my prior pipeline design and introduces **dual-issue execution** to explore instruction-level parallelism and data/control hazards across parallel paths. I focus on modular, test-driven development using randomized testbenches and waveform validation.

#### Verified Modules:
- ALU (with flags, adder/subtractor logic)
- Instruction Decoder
- Control Unit
- Hazard Detection Unit
- Forwarding Unit
- Integrated the decoder, register file, control and hazard logic in ID_Stage
- Integrated the forwarding unit and ALUs in EX_Stage

üîú Upcoming:

- IF Stage

üåê I‚Äôm currently collaborating with contributors from multiple countries on this project, fostering a diverse and supportive learning environment.

### LearnToBuildCPU ‚Äì Refactor Project ‚Äì In Progress (June 2025)
A community-focused refactoring of my original pipelined CPU project to make it more modular, well-documented, and beginner-friendly. This project features both VHDL and Verilog implementations and is designed to help others learn CPU architecture by contributing or studying the code.

Key goals:
- Simplify modules while keeping architecture accurate
- Provide dual-language support (VHDL and Verilog)
- Encourage learning by contribution (even for beginners!)
- Assign clear, self-contained tasks for contributors

üåê I‚Äôm working with contributors from around the world to build an educational CPU design resource ‚Äî the kind of hands-on project I wish I had when I was starting out.

### üîπ [Pipelined RISC-V CPU in VHDL](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/Pipelined-RISC-V-CPU-in-VHDL-From-Scratch-to-Simulation) ‚Äì Completed (June 2025)  
This project serves as the **baseline** architecture for my **LearnToBuildCPU project**, providing a fully functional and verified starting point for learners and contributors. It uses **Harvard architecture** and a traditional 5-stage pipeline. Key control and **data hazards** are handled via dedicated detection logic and resolved through **stalling and forwarding**. Also includes **jump and branch support**.

**Key Features:**
- Instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback pipeline stages  
- Hazard detection unit with stall/forward resolution  
- Support for control transfer (branches/jumps)  
- TCL scripts for batch simulation and waveform automation  
- 5,000+ randomized test cases covering edge/corner cases

üìå Finalized and stable; available for review or forking.

## Archive Repos (Earlier Work)
The earlier-stage modules listed below were **foundational to my learning and development**. Their integration and refinement can be seen in the **main pipeline repository**, where the fully integrated CPU resides. While these standalone components have been **superseded** by the final pipeline version, the **testbenches, notes, and design patterns‚Äîespecially** those involving randomized testing‚Äîmay still be helpful for anyone learning VHDL or CPU architecture.

[INSTRUCTION_FETCH](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/INSTRUCTION_FETCH)  
VHDL implementation of the Instruction Fetch stage for a custom RISC-V pipeline CPU. Includes program counter, instruction memory interface, and testbench validation.

[ID_STAGE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/ID_STAGE)  
Implements the Instruction Decode stage of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU. Extracts opcode, register values, function codes, and immediate values from a 32-bit instruction. Generates control signals and interfaces with the register file to retrieve operands.

[EX_STAGE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/EX_STAGE)  
Execute stage for a pipelined RISC-V CPU. Integrates ALU, forwarding inputs, and control logic with pipeline register support. Validated using a randomized testbench.

[MEM_STAGE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/MEM_STAGE)
Implements the Memory stage of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU. Handles lw and sw instructions, memory read/write via DATA_MEM, and passes necessary control signals. Verified with 5000 randomized test cases and waveform analysis, including intentional bug injection.

[DATA_MEM](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/DATA_MEM)  
Synchronous 32-bit word-addressable memory module with support for 1024 memory locations. Includes a reusable formatting function and randomized testbench with assertion-based verification and waveform validation.

[ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/ALU_with_testBenches_vhdl)  
A fully functional 32-bit ALU in VHDL with signed/unsigned operations, flag generation (Z, N, C, V), and comprehensive testbenches including randomized edge-case validation.

[32x32-bit Register File](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/32x32-bit-Register-File-in-VHDL-)  
Implements a synchronous register file with 32 registers, each 32 bits wide. Supports dual-read, single-write, write protection for x0, and reset logic. Verified using randomized testbenches.

[MEMORY_MODULE](https://github.com/NoridelHerron/MEMORY_MODULE)  
Instruction memory unit used in the IF stage. Designed to preload instruction data for fetch testing with reset and read-only control.
