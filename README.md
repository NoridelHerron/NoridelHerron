## 🔍 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering student driven by a passion for **problem solving** — and CPU design has been the perfect playground to exercise that skill. I built a custom **5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU** from scratch in VHDL, featuring **full hazard detection, stalling/forwarding, and jump/branch execution**. Through this, I discovered a deep interest in **RTL design, verification, and computer architecture**, which continue to shape my learning journey.

I also built a more advanced **Superscalar CPU** with dual-issue execution, modular control logic, and instruction-level parallelism. I also started the **LearnToBuildCPU refactor project** — an educational rewrite of my original pipeline CPU to help learners understand HDL design through modular, readable VHDL and Verilog code.

My workflow centers around **randomized testbenches (5K–1M tests), waveform debugging, and assertion-based verification**. I enjoy turning self-driven learning into reusable tools for others.

## 🚧 Projects

**Superscalar CPU** - Completed
- Explores instruction-level parallelism via dual-issue execution, hazard detection, and modular stage design. All major components are integrated and verified with 10K–100K randomized test cases.
- [https://github.com/NoridelHerron/SUPERSCALAR_CPU] 

**LearnToBuildCPU – Refactor Project**
- A clean, modular, and tri-language rewrite of my pipelined CPU. Includes guided tasks, waveform/test summaries, and test infrastructure. A synthesizable VHDL version runs on FPGA; Verilog/SV modules welcome.
- This is an ongoing, long-term project that will grow alongside my development in HDL and verification.
- [https://github.com/NoridelHerron/LearnToBuildCPU]

**Pipelined RISC-V CPU in VHDL** - Completed
- Implements a 5-stage Harvard pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) with hazard logic and branching. Verified with 5,000+ randomized test cases. Served as the foundation for later projects.
